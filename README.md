# FriendFinder
This is a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- (basically a dating app). This full-stack site will take in results from a users' survey questions,  then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.  I have used Express to handle routing and deployed the app to Heroku so that public users can fill it out.
